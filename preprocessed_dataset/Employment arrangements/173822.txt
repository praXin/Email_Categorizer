Rick: During the early performance review, Germain Palmer had been placed in 
the satisfactory classification because of the need to reach the goals now 
not being applied by our division. Germain is definately a "strong" and 
rising employee in this office and I would like to recommend his rating as 
"strong."

Germain has been a God send this summer and we all greatly value his 
contribution in Washington.

Thank you for your consideration of this request.

Joe
