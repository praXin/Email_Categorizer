Sorry for the delay.

Here are the next four descriptions.



Only the three liquids one waiting now.

I have sent these to David Forster in our Project group to review first 
before I send them to yourself.  If I don't get them back today I will send 
them over the weekend so they are there for you on Monday.

Could you please send me comments back on all the other descriptions today.  
Is your fax machine at your end OK?  It's just that the other fax you sent 
came through a dark background making the comments a little hard to read.

My fax is 44 171 316 5420.

Awais,

I have forwarded the descriptions you have sent us thus far to the respective 
Legal Trading Lawyers to sign off as far any legal issues we may have with 
the descriptions.  I understand your deadline is the end of the week.

When can I expect the remaining descriptions?
