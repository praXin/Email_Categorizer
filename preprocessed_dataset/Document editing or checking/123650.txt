Subject: Draft - Background and Q&A for CA residential customers

Attached is the first Q&A draft.  Please review, add questions, edit, etc.  
This will be used as a guide for media and government affairs responses.  

Evan/Diann - It needs to be tailored for use as a customer service script.
There are some blanks we could use your help on - noted in blue.  

Max Eberts at 58804 and Beth Tilney at 35022 will be the contacts for edits
via email or by phone.  I will call-in when I arrive in Washington at about 
1:30pm.

Thanks
Peggy
