Subject: ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGDE - Draft FERC Brief on Settlement Process

The attached is a rough draft of a potential filing Enron would make in to 
Judge Wagner in the Settlement process (it is unclear if this would remain 
confidential per the gag order).

Please provide Ray Alvarez your comments.  This would be filed as early as 
Monday am.
