Subject: Demonstration Procedure




This is the demonstration procedure for Enron offices.  It has been reviewed 
by Security, Legal and at least 3 PR folks.  Provided you have no issues, I 
recommend that we put it out from Mark's machine with a tip-on note to 1) 
officers, 2) PR people, 3) security people.
