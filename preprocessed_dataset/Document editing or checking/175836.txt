		 Subject: Memo Re State Processes for Takeover of Transmission

Here is an initial draft from our attorneys in California on the state 
processes that could be required.  In my experience, the single biggest issue 
the utilities have is the transfer of the rights of way -- there are 
thousands of these -- each like an individual contract.  If the state tried 
eminent domain, it seems like it could face a long-time in the courts to 
finish that process.
