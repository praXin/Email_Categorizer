To: Ad Hoc Committee

Dear Colleague,

Several of you have pointed out that the Manifesto is a bit long.  We will
endeavor to shorten it somewhat which will be possible as there is some
duplication; however, more importantly we plan to add an executive summary
which will be the editorial link version that most will read.  I hope to
get that out by 5:00 PM today.

Thanks,
David
