The letter looks fine.  Eric H's letter was addressed to "market 
participants."  Can we get EPSA or WPTF to file this letter?

Subject: Confidential Attorney Client Privilege - Attorney Work Product

I have drafted the attached letter denying the Cal ISO's request to send it 
(and the EOB) EPMI and EES' cost information for transactions over the FERC's 
cost cap.  Since I believe we are on very firm ground, my initial inclination 
was to send no response to the ISO's letter, so there would be nothing to 
quote in the press.  However, I drafted this letter at Alan's suggestion for 
purposes of discussion.  We should decide whether to send a letter before 
distributing this draft more widely in-house to discuss how to parse the 
message.
