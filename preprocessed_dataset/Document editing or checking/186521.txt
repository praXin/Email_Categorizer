Leslie--A few nits.  Prebon Energy Inc. in the first sentence should not
have a comma.

Clause (a) in the carve-out as to what constitutes Confidential Information
should start "that is or becomes..."

I would put "as demonstrable by the receiving party" in parens at the end of
clause (c).

That's it.  If you want to have the agreement signed and faxed to me at
201-557-5973, I'll have George sign it tonight or in the morning before the
call and send it back to you.

Thanks.

Attached please find a clean and red-lined version of the NDA.  Let me know
