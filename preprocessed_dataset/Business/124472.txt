Per last week's call, I am circulating updated FERC staff talking points to 
the entire Western Wholesale group.  This version of the talking points 
incorporates comments from Steffes, Walton, and Perrino.

Phillip Allen: people on the call were wondering if there are any informal 
messages the West gas desk would like to relay to FERC staff. Notes, however, 
that ex parte contacts such as these generally must avoid issues that are 
being currently litigated by the FERC.
