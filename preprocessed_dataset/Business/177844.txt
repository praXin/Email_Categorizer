Is there an alternative quote we could use instead of the reference to "stabilizing" in the California market?  I think I know what we mean but most outside readers would see the situation as unstable.  Perhaps we could reference the continued availability of direct access or renewed interest in Enron's offerings?

Subject:	UC-CSU-Enron press release


Attached is a draft of the UC-CSU-Enron press release concerning the settlement agreement.  Please review and let me know of any revisions or suggestions.  We would like for this to go out tomorrow if possible.  We're still waiting for a quote from CSU.  I'll make sure you see that as well.  Thank you.  Max
