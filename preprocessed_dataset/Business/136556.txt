According to Platt's Electric Power Daily (Fri. Aug. 24), the Administration is "leaning toward" putting the reliability function with FERC and the RTOs, NOT the NERC approach we oppose.  We will check on this independently.  We have certainly encouraged them in the direction they are now leaning toward.
