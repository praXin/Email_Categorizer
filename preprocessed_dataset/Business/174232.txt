Subject: Carin Energy Rumor

FYI,   There is a rumor on Yahoo that Enron has bid for Carin Energy.  I have 
talked with Jackie Gentle in our London Office who first heard the rumor and 
we have confirmed that neither EGEP or the London office is pursuing such a 
deal.  My guess is that it is either EOGR ( I know they are pursuing an Int'l 
deal) or just a bad release.
