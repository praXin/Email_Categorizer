At the end of last week, there was a very interesting TV news story on NBC
KRON Channel 4 in San Francisco.  You lead the story, which also includes
Governor Davis, President Bush.

What most catches my attention are the visuals and chant of the protestors
during the Enron segment.  The props and signs are very TV camera friendly.
For instance, there is a larger then life mask of you and a mockup of a
"paycheck" to you from the people of California.  The chant rhymes with your
name.

From my perspective, this was no simple pie in the face.  This protest was
very organized and sophisticated.  I think it would be prudent to gain more
information about who was behind it and who was behind them.
I tried sending you the video file in mpeg format, but at 8,400k it was too
large to email.  To see the news clip, you may double click this link

downloading, the video will play on a computer that has "Real Player."
