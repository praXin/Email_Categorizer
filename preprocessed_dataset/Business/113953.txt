Heads up.  This is not to be discussed in advance out side of Enron, but you 
guys need to know.  If there are ways we can be helpful, call Carolyn Green 
to discuss.

This will touch off a firestorm.  Diane is doing a good job, retaining 
McNally Temple in CA and even getting some message development help from our 
old friends at Public Strategies in Austin.  I'll stay on top of it.

Attached is the proposed press release, which includes input from Rebecca, 
Cole and Neil.  We are tentatively planning to issue the release Monday , 
October 11, but in case word leaks to the media from Cole's meetings with 
local landowners starting tomorrow, we may need to issue this week.  With 
that in mind, would you please provide me any comments on the attached 
document by the end of the day tomorrow, October 6.

Please note that this project has received tremendous local resistance to 
date, so we are quoting Cole and adding much more information about the local 
benefits to try to address these issues.  We are drafting a Q&A document and 
key message points for use with local and national media and the investor 
audience.
