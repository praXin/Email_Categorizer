Subject: RE: Pro Regulation speech


Steve,

Attached please find the pro-regulation speech.  We have a studio reserved
between 4 and 5 PM today.  If it's possible to get comments on the speeches
before the conference call, we would really appreciate it.  I'll forward the
edited deregulation speech to you shortly.

Thanks,

Liz
