The ISO reported that it looked at 26 companies that may have exerted market 
power.  They are listed by number only in the public.  FERC has been provided 
the actual names.

NOTE:  The ISO's Gen Counsel would not respond to a reporter's question 
asking if he gave confidential data to other state agencies.  I guess we can 
assume that means the ISO has done that.

The ISO has calculated its view of what a competitive price is for several 
months:

Jan -- $180/MWh
Feb -- $260/MWh
