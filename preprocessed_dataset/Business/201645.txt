In our July 30, 2001 document entitled "Receipt Capacity Allocation Proposal
Prepared By Salt River Project" there is an inadvertent error.  Section I.F.
properly states that the numbers used in this proposal would be updated with
peak figures through the last season prior to additional capacity being
placed into service by El Paso.  Consistent with that, Section II.A., in
describing the CD and FR Entitlement Methodology, should read as follows:

II.A.	A total "peak day entitlement" is established for each FR customer
by summing its highest (peak) 	single day takes during the period January
1, 1997 through the end of the last season prior to 	additional capacity
being placed into service by El Paso, at each of its D-Code points (eg.
DAPSPHX, DSWGPHX, etc.).  (footnotes 1 and 2 unchanged)

Please make this change to your document.  We apologize for the error.  Joel
