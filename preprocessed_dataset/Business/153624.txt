At the right time, it would be helpful to discuss what we may want to consider as "Core" Assets (unrelated to trading activities) for purposes of emerging from bankruptcy as a going concern.  As you know, we are in the process of organizing and formatting in an asset matrix the assets/businesses we currently own (or otherwise have an interest in) that may be potentially for sale; separating out potential core assets will be instructive as part of this process.

Please let me know your thoughts/suggestions over the next few weeks.
Thanks.
