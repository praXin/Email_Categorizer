Steve:

Approximately 3 weeks ago we sent you a Sponsorship proposal 
for Ware Racing.
We are curious if you've had the time to look our package over.
We have tried unsuccessfully to reach you by phone and understand 
that you are very busy.
If you have time, would you please contact us reguarding this matter.
You can reach us by phone or fax at (905) 680-1568 or on the net at
dlpits@yahoo.com.
We look forward to hearing from you.

Thank-you,
Dave/Lorna Clark
Allied Motorsports (representing WARE Racing)
