I get so worked up over this issue...  I really think now is the time to 
speak up and dissent.  Skilling told us at a floor meeting that as an 
organization we've made poor decisions in the past, and he believes it's 
because the people who disagreed with those decisions never spoke up.  So 
help me out!
