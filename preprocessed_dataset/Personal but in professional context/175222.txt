Steve and Mark, a good friend of mine works for Mr. Grimes at Stewart & 
Stevenson.  They have been offered this opportunity by the China Assoc. for 
Social and Economic Development for a commitment of $74,000.  Since Mr. Lay 
has been a past recipient (according to their attached letter), they are 
wondering if this is legit.  Can you provide any insight?  Thanks for your 
help.  SRS

Hi Sherri, 

We would be most appreciative if you can help us out on this one! 

Our President and CEO, Mike Grimes, received the letter (copy attached/please 
open) from the China Association for Social and Economic Development.? In 
this letter, Mr. Wu mentions that Dr. Kenneth Lay was a past recipient.

Well, you just called - so I won't complete this email! 

Love you - 

Doyleene
