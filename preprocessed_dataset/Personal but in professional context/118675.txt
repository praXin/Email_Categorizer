Sue:

I'm so impressed that you know how to put the link on the email.  I can't 
figure out how to do that, and I think that looks much more "high tech" than 
attaching a silly old report.

Thanks for the link.  We can take it from here.

Call me computer illiterate. I could not figure out how to download the 
report off the web site, so here's the link.
