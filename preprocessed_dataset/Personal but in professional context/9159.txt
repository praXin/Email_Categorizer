My company has been severely damaged by $50 billion (revenues)Texas based
company
1) refusal to pay  monies owed under a contract.
2)
misrepresenting information used to calculate amounts owed under the
contract
3) appears to have instigated an FBI investigation of our company
regarding a pending civil and regulatory dispute.

I am looking for an introduction to Joe Jamail by someone who knows him.
We need an attorney with the courage, confidence, and track record to
successfully pursue our claim against a powerful adversary.

Thank You.
