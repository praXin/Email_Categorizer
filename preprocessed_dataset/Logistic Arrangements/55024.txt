Frank,

Thanks for your message.

What about a meeting on Tuesday, September the 4th.
We could meet at your office, let's say at 4 p.m. We would be delighted if you
could join us for dinner later in the evening on the same day.


Vince

Vince,

 I'll be out of the country for the next
two weeks, but should be back September 3
and will be in the office all that week.
