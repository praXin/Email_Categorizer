Subject:	BABC-Houston Newsletter



We are publishing photographs of board members in the upcoming issue of the
BABC-Houston newsletter. Please provide us with a photo (in color if
possible).
Will you also include a short biography? Your response by this Friday will be
helpful. We hope to have the newsletter out early next week.

Thank you!
