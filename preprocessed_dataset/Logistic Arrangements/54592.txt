Shirley,

I shall pay for the trip, I cannot pay for the conference.

Hi Vince.

We really feel that there could be enormous benefit to your presenting at the SMS conference.
So few people are actually using real options in practice and we feel that the topic is critical in these uncertain times.
I am very happy to cover the conference costs out of my Chair budget - that is what the Chair is for!
