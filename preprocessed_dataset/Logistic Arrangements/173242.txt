SK - I let Sherri know that you are planning to go and that I have it on your 
calendar.  mm

Steve, I believe we discussed your attendance at the April 15-17 NAM board 
meeting at Loews Ventana Canyon (Tucson, AZ), in so far as Jeff is not 
available these dates.  Please confirm that you are attending in his place, 
and I'll forward the information he received today.  Sorry - my memory is 
getting worse by the minute!  SRS
